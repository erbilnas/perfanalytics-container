## Overview

It's an example application where I have dockerized two different projects, Perfanalytics Dashboard and Perfanalytics API, in a single container that can serve.

You can try on your local machine using this command:

```shell
$ docker-compose up --build
```

Because of some Heroku problems, I can't deploy this project, but it works well on local machine.
